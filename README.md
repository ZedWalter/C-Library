# Overview

This is a program I wrote to learn more about C++. It involves the use of classes, methods, and lists. I built the program to function as a Library, you are given a menu with options allowing you to store books into the "library" (eventually hopefully a database but for now just a list). You can then check out books from the library and check them back in as needed. It allows for the searching for a specific book to see if it is checked out or not and has error handling when trying to check out a book that is currently checked out.

# Future Work

* More error handling is necessary in a few places
* Update the checkout display to be more clear
* Change input method to getline to allow longer inputs
* Change from a list to a database to remember inputs
